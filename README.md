# Sass Boilerplate

This is a sass boilerplate to be used for new projects that utilize sass for styling. This will be updated as I work through projects depending on what I use often and what is needed.

The file currently contains the following.

- A file structure that resemblers the 7 - 1 architecture.
- Files created for breakpoints, colors and type where the project specific details can be added directly to them.
- Files created for general styling and typography styling where the content can be added directly.
- A CSS Reset
- A file for a button component.
- The follwing functions.
  - Function to convert a px value to an em value
  - Function to conver a px value to a rem value
  - Function to retrive color values from the color map
- The follwing mixins
  - A mixin that takes in a size or a breakpoint for media queries
- The following utility classes
  - A function that takes in the colors from the color map and creats a text color and a background color class for each one of the colors.
  - A SR-Only class to be added to SR only elements.
